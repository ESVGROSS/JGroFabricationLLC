                <p>Jacob Gross, born in Missouri and raised in Pennsylvania, now proudly resides with his family in the
                    picturesque Golden Isles of coastal Georgia.
                </p>
                <p>Jacob began his career in the Army National Guard as an aircraft powertrain mechanic, eventually
                    advancing to
                    become an allied trades specialist, welder/fabricator, and attaining the rank of Sergeant. His
                    journey with
                    metalwork began at the Army Aviation Support Facility of Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, where he
                    developed a passion for metalworking after completing a Non-destructive Inspection Testing Course.
                </p>
                <p>Educationally, Jacob attended the Berks Career &amp; Technology Center, where he honed his skills and
                    earned
                    several qualifications, including AWS D1.6 1G SS GTAW, AWS D1.1 3G MS FCAW, AWS D1.1 &amp; AWS D1.5
                    3G MS SMAW,
                    and ASME Section 9 6G MS GTAW. He also achieved his AWS D17.1 Class A aerospace welding
                    certification,
                    demonstrating his commitment to excellence in welding craftsmanship.</p>
                <p>Following his military service, Jacob gained valuable experience working across various fabrication
                    sectors,
                    including cryogenics, food-grade, pharmaceutical, aerospace, and general welding applications in
                    both
                    government and private sectors. His diverse expertise prepared him to venture into entrepreneurship.
                </p>
                <p>Driven by a desire to align his professional pursuits with his personal values, Jacob embarked on the
                    journey
                    of entrepreneurship to prioritize his passions and family life. Today, he is the founder of his own
                    successful business, where he continues to uphold high standards of craftsmanship and service.</p>
                <p>Beyond his professional endeavors, Jacob is an active volunteer for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy
                    and
                    Keep McIntosh Beautiful, reflecting his commitment to environmental stewardship and community
                    involvement.
                    In his leisure time, Jacob enjoys the outdoors through hiking and fishing, indulges in billiards,
                    pursues
                    his passion for aviation as a student pilot, and finds exhilaration in skydiving adventures.</p>
